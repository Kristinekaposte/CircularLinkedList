Implement a singly circularly linked list. Create these separate functions:

2. some position in the list,

3. the end of the list,

#### deleteNode() – to delete an element at:  

1. the beginning of the list,

2. some position in the list,

3. the end of the list,

#### search() – to find an element in the list,

#### isEmpty() – to check whether a list is empty,

#### display() – to print a list.
